## [1.1.0] - 2025-12-26

### Added
- **Duplicate Prevention System**: Analytics data is now compared with previously sent data to prevent duplicates from being stored in the database
- **LocalStorage Fingerprint**: Visitor fingerprint now persists in localStorage across browser sessions for consistent identification
- `getNewData()` function in data controller that filters out duplicate analytics before sending

### Changed
- Fingerprint generation now happens only once per browser and is stored in localStorage with key `teacupnet_fingerprint`
- Analytics save function now only sends API requests when there is new data to transmit
- Data comparison logic ensures button clicks, page views, and form interactions are only sent once

### Fixed
- Duplicate button clicks on the same page are no longer sent multiple times
- Same page scroll percentages are no longer duplicated in database
- Form completion percentages only update when they change
- Reduced unnecessary API calls when no new analytics data is available

### Performance
- Reduced database writes by filtering duplicates before transmission
- Reduced network requests by skipping empty data intervals
- Fingerprint generation optimized to run only once per browser session
